Temporary passes (TPR's) are used to let us know you won't be at the regularly scheduled operation for the week.

**Temporary Passes**:
- Let us balance missions by forecasting turnout; unscheduled absences can diminish others' experiences.
- Track campaign attendance; consistent no-shows may be removed from leadership roles.
- Donâ€™t require a reason and can cover real-life situations.
- TPR's shouldn't be used week-to-week. For extended absences, submit a Leave of Absence (LOA) instead.

Please submit TPR's promptly when needed.
