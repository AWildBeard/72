Squad XML is a ArmA3 facet that lets you advertise your unit and rank in-game. It is viewable on the map interface under the players tab.
Be sure to put in a Squad XML request with every promotion so we can ensure your unit patch stays with you in-game.

In order to utilize SquadXML, you'll need one of the following links depending on your section.
1. Platoon: `https://72ndairborne.com/squadxml/airborne/squad.xml`
2. ACE: `https://72ndairborne.com/squadxml/aviation/squad.xml`
3. ODA: `https://72ndairborne.com/squadxml/oda/squad.xml`

Paste the appropriate link for you into the Squad URL section of your ArmA3 Profile in-game.

Next, retrieve:
1. Your Name. This should be your platform name (I.E. `SSG A. Hydra`)
2. Your Player ID. You can get your Player ID from the ArmA3 Profile Menu.

When you're ready to continue, use the button below to add your Name and Player ID to the request.
