Transfer requests allow you to move from your current combat unit to another unit, section (e.g., ACE), or Reserves. Common reasons include joining a friend's section, desire for a different gameplay experience, or issues in your current unit.

**Approvals:**
- Not all requests are approved. Denials may occur due to capacity limits, qualifications, or section commander decisions.
